I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to **[Umair Khalid](https://github.com/UmairKhalid786)** for his outstanding work on the **[ComposeTv](https://github.com/UmairKhalid786/ComposeTv)** repository. His well-structured code and clear documentation have been essential resources throughout this process, enabling me to learn and apply new techniques in Jetpack Compose development.  

A huge thank you to the community for their efforts and contributions to the open-source ecosystem. I hope this project can also be a valuable resource for other developers! üöÄüôè  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer  

This project has been developed **exclusively for learning and experimentation purposes**. **Fudge** is an exploratory Jetpack Compose UI kit designed to gain insights into TV interface development, focus management, and state handling in Android applications.  


### Features üéâ

- **Pre-defined Components:** Fudge provides a range of ready-to-use components optimized for TV, including focusable buttons, lists, and custom navigation drawers, ensuring your app looks and performs beautifully on the big screen.
- **Focus Management:** Built with TV in mind, Fudge simplifies focus handling and navigation, making it easier to manage remote control interactions.
- **State Management:** Supports advanced screen state management by implementing patterns like MVI (Model-View-Intent) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), delivering fluid and responsive UIs.
- **Customization:** Fudge components are highly customizable, allowing you to adapt them to match the unique style and branding of your TV application.
- **Jetpack Compose Compatibility:** Fully integrated with Jetpack Compose, the modern Android UI framework, ensuring a seamless and efficient development experience tailored for TV platforms.

## Model-View-Intent (MVI) Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Fudge encourages the use of the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern for effective screen state management. In this pattern:

- **Model:** Represents the state of the UI. Fudge provides a `FudgeTvViewModel` class that extends from `ViewModel` and handles the UI state.
- **View:** Renders the UI based on the state provided by the ViewModel. Fudge components are seamlessly integrated with Compose to create a declarative UI.
- **Intent:** Represents user actions or events that trigger state changes. Fudge's components, like buttons and text fields, are designed to emit these intents efficiently.

This setup leverages Fudge's components and ViewModel to accelerate the development of robust features while adhering to best practices in architecture and UI design.

Here's an example of how you can use FudgeTv components in a screen following the MVI pattern:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SignInScreen(
    viewModel: SignInViewModel = hiltViewModel(),
    onGoToHome: () -> Unit,
    onGoToProfiles: () -> Unit,
    onGoToSignUp: () -> Unit,
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit,
) {
    FudgeTvScreen(
        viewModel = viewModel,
        onBackPressed = onBackPressed,
        onInitialUiState = { SignInUiState() },
        onSideEffect = {
            when(it) {
                SignInSideEffects.AuthenticationSuccessfully -> onGoToHome()
                SignInSideEffects.ProfileSelectionRequired -> onGoToProfiles()
                SignInSideEffects.CreateNewAccount -> onGoToSignUp()
            }
        }
    ) { uiState ->
        SignInScreenContent(
            uiState = uiState,
            actionListener = viewModel
        )
    }
}
```

Inside the SignInScreen function, there's a FudgeTvScreen composable. This is a custom screen component provided by the FudgeTV library. It's responsible for managing the UI state and handling side effects in a declarative way. Here's what each parameter does:

- **viewModel:** The **SignInViewModel** instance passed to the **FudgeTvScreen** component.
- **onBackPressed:** The lambda function passed to the **FudgeTvScreen** component, which is called when the user navigates back from the screen.
- **onInitialUiState:** A lambda function that provides the initial UI state for the screen. In this case, it returns a new instance of **SignInUiState.**
- **onSideEffect:** A lambda function that handles side effects triggered by the ViewModel. When a side effect occurs (such as successful authentication or profile selection required), this function is called, and appropriate actions (navigating to home or profile selection) are performed.

Finally, inside the FudgeTvScreen composable, there's another composable function called **SignInScreenContent.** This is the actual content of the sign-in screen, where UI elements like text fields, buttons, etc., are defined. It takes the current UI state (uiState) as a parameter and callback functions for handling user interactions:

- **uiState:** The current state of the sign-in screen, which is provided by the FudgeTvScreen component.
- **onEmailChanged:** A callback function for handling changes in the email input field.
- **onPasswordChanged:** A callback function for handling changes in the password input field.
- **onSignIn:** A callback function for handling the sign-in action.

Overall, this implementation follows a declarative approach using Compose and Fudge components, making it easier to manage the UI state and handle user interactions in a clear and concise manner.

```kotlin
@Composable
internal fun SignInScreenContent(
    uiState: SignInUiState,
    actionListener: SignInScreenActionListener
) {
    FudgeTvScreenContent(
        error = uiState.errorMessage,
        onErrorAccepted = actionListener::onErrorMessageCleared
    ) {
        SignInDialog(uiState = uiState)
        SignInVideoBackground()
        SignInLogo()
        Column(
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxHeight()
                .fillMaxWidth(0.9f),
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
        ) {
            SignInMainContent(
                uiState = uiState,
                onEmailChanged = actionListener::onEmailChanged,
                onPasswordChanged = actionListener::onPasswordChanged,
                onSigInPressed = actionListener::onSigInPressed
            )
            SignInSecondaryContent(onGoToSignUp = actionListener::onGoToSignUp)
        }
    }
}
```

This is a Composable function named **SignInScreenContent**, responsible for rendering the content of the sign-in screen. It takes the following parameters:

- **uiState:** The current state of the sign-in screen, containing properties like isLoading, email, and password.
- **onEmailChanged:** A callback function that will be invoked when the email input field changes.
- **onPasswordChanged:** A callback function that will be invoked when the password input field changes.
- **onSignIn:** A callback function that will be invoked when the user clicks the sign-in button.

The **FudgeTvScreenContent** composable is used to create a screen layout. It takes a title resource as a parameter.

Overall, the **SignInScreenContent** composable is responsible for rendering the content of the sign-in screen using Fudge's components. It ensures a consistent UI design and handles user interactions efficiently through callback functions.

## Using FudgeTV UI Library

### Step 1: Configuring Maven Repository

Ensure to add the GitHub Maven repository to your `build.gradle` or `settings.gradle` file to access the dependency hosted on GitHub Packages:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/sergio11/fudge_tv_compose_library")
        credentials {
            // Here, set your authentication credentials
            username = githubProperties["gpr.usr"] as String? ?: System.getenv("GPR_USER")
            password = githubProperties["gpr.key"] as String? ?: System.getenv("GPR_API_KEY")
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Adding the Dependency to the Project
Once the repository is configured, you can add the "Fudge: Jetpack Compose TV UI Kit" dependency to your project.

```
fudge-tv-compose = "CURRENT_VERSION"
fudge-tv-compose = { module = "com.dreamsoftware.libraries:fudge-tv-compose", version.ref = "fudge-tv-compose" }
```

```kotin
implementation(libs.fudge.tv.compose)
```
